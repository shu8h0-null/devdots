<h3> Config files I use for development</h3>


<p>
How to use? <br>

-> Copy the config files to their respective config dirs...<br>
-> Or if you are on Arch linux, you can just run the install script
</p>


> [!WARNING]
>
>  Don't run the script blindly unless you know what it entails...

install.sh does 3 things:
+ installs the following packages:
    + [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
    + [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
    + [nvim](https://neovim.io)
    + [starship](https://starship.rs)
    + [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd) (use it with nerd fonts for file icons)
+ Clones 3 zsh plugins that I use
    + [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
    + [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    + [supercharge](https://github.com/zap-zsh/supercharge)
+ copies all the config files to their appropriate directories
